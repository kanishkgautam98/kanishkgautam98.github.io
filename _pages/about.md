one stop platform where health of the services, their respective instances and also other details like API
documentation (Swagger), Splunk logs etc. is present.
* Was involved in all requirement gathering and design discussions of reporting service which is responsible
for generating various substantial reports from two data sources (DB2 & Mongo) using GraphQL.
*  Developed, tested and automated reporting service.
*  Proposed, designed, and developed a feature flag system with the help of Spring boot, Redis and ReactJS,
which can change features at runtime from APIs to downstream services and data sources, such that
release rollbacks are not required and features can be switched easily by changing the feature flag.
* Developed a JAR checker job, which validates whether all the service instances are running on the same jar
version.
* Involved in the development of onboarding an external client to our automated trading engine.
* Worked on onboarding our service’s logs to Splunk.

## [An attempt on Twitter ‘likes’ grading strategy using pure linguistic feature engineering: a novel approach](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Me_9zAYCTjH_8zrEM9UQvpjonlyonhsx/view?usp=sharing)

### Abstract
Twitter is one of the people’s favorite social media platform used for sharing thoughts about different aspects may it
 be emotional like ‘love’, ‘motivation’, ‘dedication’, etc. businesses like ‘marketing’, ‘startup’, ‘blogging’, etc. or health
 like ‘gym’, ‘fitness’, ‘food’, etc., and similar areas. People follow hashtags for topics in their interest. Agreement of a 
tweet can be measured by likes or retweets. This paper deals with pure linguistic features other than using 
embeddings in vector space via TFIDF or Doc2Vec. This paper deals with a collection of tweets on such hashtags and 
classifying the level of likes the tweet will get using pure linguistic features in the form of a grade.
