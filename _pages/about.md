# Work Experience #

## Goldman Sachs ##

* Developed, tested, automated and deployed application performance/health monitoring service, a onestop platform where the health of the services, their respective instances and other details like API documentation (Swagger), Splunk logs, etc. is present.
* Was involved in all requirement gathering and design discussions of reporting service, which is responsible
for generating various substantial reports from two data sources (DB2 & Mongo) using GraphQL.
* Developed, tested and automated reporting service.
* Proposed, designed and developed a feature flag system with Spring boot, Redis and ReactJS, which can
change features at runtime from APIs to downstream services and data sources, such that release rollbacks
are not required, and features can be switched easily by changing the feature flag.
* Developed a JAR checker job, which validates whether all the service instances are running on the same jar
version.
* Involved in the development of onboarding an external client to our automated trading engine.
* Worked on onboarding our service’s logs to Splunk.
* Developed a new feature for searching trades in one of our services.
* Involved in bug analysis and bug fixes.
* Created Gitlab pipeline for the application performance monitoring service and presented a demo to the
team.
* Created a Cron job for enhancing automation testing performed by the QA team.

## OYO Rooms ##

* Enhanced backend services responsible for onboarding various properties like hotels, homes and
vacation stays to the OYO ecosystem, from the old monolith architecture to microservices.
* Worked on deal creation algorithm for commercial deals between OYO & Property Owners based
on various factors.
* Developed, tested and deployed, a feature to create pdf contract between OYO and property
owners by pulling data from various microservices, which was being done manually earlier.
* Developed, tested and deployed, meeting-related enhancements that allowed business development
managers to store data related to meetings, user-wise and country wise.
* Developed a feature of mapping various business development managers under appropriate business
development heads.
* Solved the out-of-memory issue for one of our services while working as an on-call engineer.
* Directly worked with the business team, from gathering business requirements to designing the solution
and successfully deploying it on to production.
* Responsible for handling tasks related to bug fixing, maintenance and new-features.

#### Abstract
Twitter is one of the people’s favorite social media platform used for sharing thoughts about different aspects may it be emotional like ‘love’, ‘motivation’, ‘dedication’, etc. businesses like ‘marketing’, ‘startup’, ‘blogging’, etc. or health like ‘gym’, ‘fitness’, ‘food’, etc., and similar areas. People follow hashtags for topics in their interest. Agreement of a tweet can be measured by likes or retweets. This paper deals with pure linguistic features other than using embeddings in vector space via TFIDF or Doc2Vec. This paper deals with a collection of tweets on such hashtags and classifying the level of likes the tweet will get using pure linguistic features in the form of a grade.
