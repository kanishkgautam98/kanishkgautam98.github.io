# Work Experience #

## Goldman Sachs ##

*	Developed, tested, automated, and deployed application performance/health monitoring service, a one-stop platform where the health of the services, their respective instances and other details like API documentation (Swagger), Splunk logs, etc., is present.
* Gathered requirements, discussed design, developed, tested and deployed reporting service, responsible for generating various substantial financial reports from two data sources (DB2 & Mongo) using GraphQL and several inter-service calls.
* Proposed, designed and developed a feature flag system with Spring boot, Redis and ReactJS, which can change features at runtime from APIs to downstream services and data sources, such that release rollbacks are not required, and features can be switched easily by changing the feature flag.
* Revamped the automated trading engine to onboard an external client.
* Developed a JAR checker job, which validates whether all the service instances are running on the same jar version.
* Worked on onboarding our service’s logs to Splunk.
* Developed Cron jobs to enhance automated testing performed by the QA team.
* Developed Gitlab pipeline for one of the new services.
*	Onboarded our service’s logs to Splunk.
* Developed a new feature of searching trades in one of our services.
* Involved in bug analysis and bug fixes.

## OYO Rooms ##

*	Enhanced backend services responsible for onboarding various properties like hotels, homes, and vacation stays to the OYO ecosystem, from the old monolith architecture to microservices.
* Worked on deal creation algorithm for commercial deals between OYO & Property Owners based on various factors.
* Developed, tested and deployed, feature to create pdf contracts between OYO and property owners by pulling data from various microservices, which was done manually earlier.
* Developed, tested and deployed, meeting-related enhancements that allowed business development managers to store data related to meetings, user-wise and country wise.
* Developed a feature of mapping various business development managers under appropriate business development heads.
* Solved the out-of-memory issue (SEV-1) for one of our services while working as an on-call engineer.

#### Abstract
Twitter is one of the people’s favorite social media platform used for sharing thoughts about different aspects may it be emotional like ‘love’, ‘motivation’, ‘dedication’, etc. businesses like ‘marketing’, ‘startup’, ‘blogging’, etc. or health like ‘gym’, ‘fitness’, ‘food’, etc., and similar areas. People follow hashtags for topics in their interest. Agreement of a tweet can be measured by likes or retweets. This paper deals with pure linguistic features other than using embeddings in vector space via TFIDF or Doc2Vec. This paper deals with a collection of tweets on such hashtags and classifying the level of likes the tweet will get using pure linguistic features in the form of a grade.
